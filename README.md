Improvements based on previous feedback
-	Game mechanics are not as fairly standard (I hope).
-	Made the overall game feel more natural (no invisible walls).
-	Torch in the dark now has no sharp edges.
-	Animations are no longer minimal (Did them all myself).
-	Enemy behaviour is further improved. 
-	Made use of [SerializeField].
-	Made use of MonoBehaviours methods such as FixedUpdate, Awake, OnEnable etc.
-	Implemented standard C# events. 
-	Adhered to .NET standards throughout the project. 
-	Less hardcoded data.
-	Avoided using strings for identifiers. Used enums instead. 
-	Implemented design patterns such as Singleton, State, and Observer.
